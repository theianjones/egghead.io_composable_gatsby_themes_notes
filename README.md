# egghead.io Composable Gatsby Themes Notes

This repo contains notes from [Chris Biscardi](https://www.christopherbiscardi.com/)'s [gatsby themes course](https://egghead.io/lessons/gatsby-set-up-a-shopify-account).

These notes contain a lot of verbatim transcriptions, along with additional rewrites, links, etc. that have been added along the way. Feel free to submit additions to these notes, but please don't remove anything (unless we messed up or misunderstood something).

Generally, there is one document for each lesson in the course. If there are related lessons, the notes will be in the same document. Each section contains a link to the video.

## Prerequisites

[Gatsby Theme Authoring](https://egghead.io/courses/gatsby-theme-authoring)

## Course Goal

To publish a theme or 2 that work together. Go from “you have this monolithic site” to “the site is a set of composable themes with core themes backing them” that can be published and maintained in a way that others can use them.

## Course Summary

When you see the word “theme” you might think of the visual aspects of a site or code editor where setting an option in one place can change the look everywhere.
Gatsby Themes take this idea to another level by allowing you to change and compose entire pieces of functionality.
In this advanced course, you will iteratively convert a fictitious SaaS website with marketing, eCommerce, blog, and dashboard pages into a set of horizontally composed Gatsby Themes.
After everything's been split up, you will build a deeper understanding of parent/child theme relationships by exploring the blog data model with schema customization APIs that allow us to create multiple child themes with data sourced from different node types.
